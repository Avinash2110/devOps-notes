# DevOps:
It's a cultural practice in an organization by development team and operation's team to use   each others tool, to smooth out the process of software delivery.

## CAMS Model to understand devOps movement:  
* **CULTURE**: Culture is the most important part of devOps movement. It gives importance  
to teams to talk to each other. It includes a whole lot of activities like the  
use of scrum, the presence of silos, the willness to limit the level of technical debt.  

* **AUTOMATION**: Automation is there to speed up the flow of information and avoid  
recruiting people. Speeding helps to get results earlier and so if a problem occurs  
earlier, it costs much less than if it is discovered later.

* **MEASUREMENT**: The continuous improvement process is at the heart of the devOps.  
Whether we have improved from earlier or not, we need to prove it. To prove, measures  
are the key. Therefore, it is very important to on-board monitoring services in the provided applications.  

* **SHARING**: Share responsibility, share ownership and no escape goat. Feedback loop  
is important.  

## devOps 3 ways:  
* Flow thinking  
* Amplify feedback  
* Experiment and learn  

## Overview of devOps:  
* People over processes over tools.  
* Continuous delivery.  
* lean management.  
* infrastructure as code.  

## DevOps Terms:  
* *Provisioning*: Server is ready with OS, softwares and networking.  
* *Deployment*: adding or upgrading software on server.  
* *Orchestration*: coordinated operation on multiple systems.  
* *Configuration Management*: managing server configuration via files such as ram, space,  
dependency softwares etc.  
* *Imperative(Procedural)*: commands to produce desired state.  
* *Declarative*: desired state is defined and tools will achieve it.  
* *Idempotent*: repeat execution and same result.  
* *blue green deployment*: identical deployment, used as switch.  
* *Continuous Integration*: Build and unit test at every checkin.  
* *Continuous Delivery*: deploy on production live environment at every checkin.  
* *Continuous Deployment*: After unit testing, deploy changes to production in small batches.
